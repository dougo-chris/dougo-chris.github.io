  I've been a developer for over 20 years and every few years I like to learn something new.

  When I first started it was all C/C++. Then it was Java. I moved completely to Ruby in 2007 and today I'm using Elixir.

  As I learn new things I use this site to keep a record of what worked for me.

  It is simply my guide to <strong>Getting S**t Done</strong>.
